# ObjectOrientedProgramming
## OOP
### What is?


### Pillars
* [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
* [Inheritance](#inheritance) 
* [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)
* [Abstraction](#abstraction)


### Advantages


## Inheritance
> Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

### extends Keyword
extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class. Following is the syntax of extends keyword.

```Java
class Super {
   .....
   .....
}
class Sub extends Super {
   .....
   .....
}
```

### The super keyword
> The super keyword is similar to this keyword. Following are the scenarios where the super keyword is used.

* It is used to differentiate the members of superclass from the members of subclass, if they have same names.
* It is used to invoke the superclass constructor from subclass. 

```Java
super.variable
super.method();
```

### Invoking Superclass Constructor
> If a class is inheriting the properties of another class, the subclass automatically acquires the default constructor of the superclass. But if you want to call a parameterized constructor of the superclass, you need to use the super keyword as shown below.

```Java
super(values);
```
### IS-A Relationship
> IS-A is a way of saying: This object is a type of that object. Let us see how the extends keyword is used to achieve inheritance.

```Java
public class Animal {
}

public class Mammal extends Animal {
}

public class Reptile extends Animal {
}

public class Dog extends Mammal {
}
```

* Animal is the superclass of Mammal class.
* Animal is the superclass of Reptile class.
* Mammal and Reptile are subclasses of Animal class.
* Dog is the subclass of both Mammal and Animal classes.

If we consider the IS-A relationship:
* Mammal IS-A Animal
* Reptile IS-A Animal
* Dog IS-A Mammal
* Hence: Dog IS-A Animal as well

### The instanceof Keyword
> Let us use the instanceof operator to check determine whether Mammal is actually an Animal, and dog is actually an Animal.

### HAS-A relationship
> These relationships are mainly based on the usage. This determines whether a certain class HAS-A certain thing. This relationship helps to reduce duplication of code as well as bugs.

```Java
public class Vehicle{}
public class Speed{}

public class Van extends Vehicle {
   private Speed sp;
} 
```
___This shows that class Van HAS-A Speed.___

### Types
* **Single:**
  * A single super and a single subclass
* **Multi Level:**
  * A class inherits from another class that inherits from a super class
* **Herarchical:**
  * More than one class inherits from a superclass
* **Multiple:**
  * A class inherits from more than one super class (It is not supported by Java)

## Overriding
> If a class inherits a method from its superclass, then there is a chance to override the method provided that it is not marked final.
>The benefit of overriding is: ability to define a behavior that's specific to the subclass type, which means a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.
>In object-oriented terms, overriding means to override the functionality of an existing method.

In compile time, the check is made on the reference type. However, in the runtime, JVM figures out the object type and would run the method that belongs to that particular object.

### Rules
* The argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method.
* The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the original overridden method in the superclass.
* The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level. For example: If the superclass method is declared public then the overridding method in the sub class cannot be either private or protected.
* Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.
* A method declared final cannot be overridden.
* A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.
* If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.
* A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.
* A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protected.
* An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions, regardless of whether the overridden method throws exceptions or not. However, the overriding method should not throw checked exceptions that are new or broader than the ones declared by the overridden method. The overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions than the overridden method.
* Constructors cannot be overridden.

### Using the super Keyword
> When invoking a superclass version of an overridden method the super keyword is used.

## Polymorphism
> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

```Java
public interface Vegetarian{}
public class Animal{}
public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian{}
```
Deer class is considered to be polymorphic since this has multiple inheritance.
* A Deer IS-A Animal
* A Deer IS-A Vegetarian
* A Deer IS-A Deer
* A Deer IS-A Object
```Java
Deer d = new Deer();
Animal a = d;
Vegetarian v = d;
Object o = d;
```
___All the reference variables d, a, v, o refer to the same Deer object in the heap.___

### Virtual Methods
> An overridden method is essentially hidden in the parent class, and is not invoked unless the child class uses the super keyword within the overriding method.


## Abstraction

> In Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

In Java, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.

### Abstract Class
A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is known as abstract class.

* Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )
* But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.
* If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.
* To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
* If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.

### Abstract Methods
If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual implementation of that method to be determined by child classes, you can declare the method in the parent class as an abstract.

* abstract keyword is used to declare the method as abstract.
* You have to place the abstract keyword before the method name in the method declaration.
* An abstract method contains a method signature, but no method body.
* Instead of curly braces, an abstract method will have a semoi colon (;) at the end.

Declaring a method as abstract has two consequences âˆ’

* The class containing it must be declared as abstract.
* Any class inheriting the current class must either override the abstract method or declare itself as abstract.

> ___**Note:** Eventually, a descendant class has to implement the abstract method; otherwise, you would have a hierarchy of abstract classes that cannot be instantiated.___

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

> Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java:
* Declare the variables of a class as private.
* Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

The public setXXX() and getXXX() methods are the access points of the instance variables of the class. Normally, these methods are referred as getters and setters. Therefore, any class that wants to access the variables should access them through these getters and setters.

### Benefits of Encapsulation
* The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
* A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.

## Interfaces

> An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

> Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.

> Writing an interface is similar to writing a class. But a class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. And an interface contains behaviors that a class implements.

> Unless the class that implements the interface is abstract, all the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class.

An interface is similar to a class:
* An interface can contain any number of methods.
* An interface is written in a file with a .java extension, with the name of the interface matching the name of the file.
* The byte code of an interface appears in a .class file.
* Interfaces appear in packages, and their corresponding bytecode file must be in a directory structure that matches the package name.
However, an interface is different from a class in several ways:
* You cannot instantiate an interface.
* An interface does not contain any constructors.
* All of the methods in an interface are abstract.
* An interface cannot contain instance fields. The only fields that can appear in an interface must be declared both static and final.
* An interface is not extended by a class; it is implemented by a class.
* An interface can extend multiple interfaces.

### properties:

* An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the abstract keyword while declaring an interface.
* Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract keyword is not needed.
* Methods in an interface are implicitly public.

### Declaring Interfaces
The interface keyword is used to declare an interface.

### Implementing Interfaces
When a class implements an interface, you can think of the class as signing a contract, agreeing to perform the specific behaviors of the interface. If a class does not perform all the behaviors of the interface, the class must declare itself as abstract.

A class uses the implements keyword to implement an interface. The implements keyword appears in the class declaration following the extends portion of the declaration.

Overriding methods:
* Checked exceptions should not be declared on implementation methods other than the ones declared by the interface method or subclasses of those declared by the interface method.
* The signature of the interface method and the same return type or subtype should be maintained when overriding the methods.
* An implementation class itself can be abstract and if so, interface methods need not be implemented.

Implementation interfaces:
* A class can implement more than one interface at a time.
* A class can extend only one class, but implement many interfaces.
* An interface can extend another interface, in a similar way as a class can extend another class.

Extending Interfaces
> An interface can extend another interface in the same way that a class can extend another class. The extends keyword is used to extend an interface, and the child interface inherits the methods of the parent interface.
```Java
// Filename: Sports.java
public interface Sports {
   public void setHomeTeam(String name);
   public void setVisitingTeam(String name);
}

// Filename: Football.java
public interface Football extends Sports {
   public void homeTeamScored(int points);
   public void visitingTeamScored(int points);
   public void endOfQuarter(int quarter);
}

// Filename: Hockey.java
public interface Hockey extends Sports {
   public void homeGoalScored();
   public void visitingGoalScored();
   public void endOfPeriod(int period);
   public void overtimePeriod(int ot);
}
```

### Extending Multiple Interfaces
> A Java class can only extend one parent class. Multiple inheritance is not allowed. Interfaces are not classes, however, and an interface can extend more than one parent interface.

```Java
public interface Hockey extends Sports, Event
```

## Packages

> Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, to make searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier, etc.

> A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and namespace management.
